I am an applied microeconomist studying decision-making in both private and public sector settings, and how it shapes organizational performance, service delivery, and development outcomes.

I have led and contributed to studies employing experimental and non-experimental methods including field experiments, natural experiments, and causal inference with large administrative datasets, to study entrepreneurship, management, public sector accountability, and health and education delivery in low-capacity contexts in multiple contexts across South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. My research is designed to be relevant for both development organizations and data-driven companies aiming to improve the effectiveness and scalability of their programs, platforms, or interventions.

Currently, I am a Research Fellow at Princeton University, where I work on applied policy questions in development economics and political economy. I hold a Ph.D. in Business and Public Policy from the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, a Master in Public Policy from the Harvard Kennedy School, and a BSc (Honors) in Economics from the Lahore University of Management Sciences.
