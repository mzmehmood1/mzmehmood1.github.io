Welcome!

I’m a PhD candidate at UC Berkeley in the Business and Public Policy group at the Haas School of Business. I hold a Masters in Public Policy from the Harvard Kennedy School, and a BSc. (honors) in Economics from the Lahore University of Management Sciences (Pakistan).

My research interests are in Development Economics and Political Economy.

**I am on the 2023/2024 academic job market.**
