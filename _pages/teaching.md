**Comments From Most Recent MBA Teaching Evaluations**

* "Zia was not only incredibly personable and an entertaining person to  teach our sections but he is highly knowledgeable of economics as a whole and was easily able to answer all of our questions for him. He was succinct thorough and clear in all of his instructions and responses and I don't know if I've ever had a GSI before that could do this so well. He didn't skip a beat and our whole cohort was a huge fan of Zia."
* "Zia was excellent. His sections were extremely helpful in explaining the math behind the material we covered in class."
* "Very clear in his teaching and obliging with his help"
* "Zia is awesome and does a great job helping students apply the concepts learned in class to real-world problems and examples."
* "Zia was so well-prepared for each discussion section and took the time to explain his thinking and work in a way that was accessible to all. His sessions were the ones I prioritized over other commitments which is about the highest praise for a TA that I can think of coming from an MBA student."
* "Zia is extremely effective at communicating and walking students through the genuine requirement of the course: the ability to solve complex problems based off basic concepts introduced in the in-person classes. I would not have been able to process any of the exam-related material without Zia."
* "Zia was the best we were so lucky to have him as our GSI"
* "Zia is so good! His sense of humor and ability to slow down and break down concepts repeat concepts and really work to drive home understanding."

* "He is very helpful and clear in explaining!"
* "Zia's funny knowledgeable patient and nice. He makes econ fun!"
